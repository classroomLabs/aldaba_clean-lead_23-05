# Prototype

## Creates a copy (_clone_) of an existing object with controlled changes (_mutations_)

We want to create a copy of an object but change some of its properties. The prototype pattern is an excellent solution for this situation. By cloning an existing object, we can create a new one with the desired changes while ensuring the defaults are correct.
